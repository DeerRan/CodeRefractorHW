# CodeRefractorHW

Notes:
    Not sure if I did this properly but hopefully everything works. I have the same files given to me in the homework in this repo, the only changes being to the HTML and CSS files of the project website. 
    The reason I copied everything over is so the website has all of it's images and assets available in order to function properly.
