# CodeRefractorHW

Notes:
    This repo serves as a submission method for my homework titled Code Refractor. The purpose of this homework was to make the website more accessable by giving many elements alt attributes and organizing the code into a more logical structure.
    
    I have the same files given to me in the homework in this repo, the only changes being to the HTML and CSS files of the project website. 
    The reason I copied everything over is so the website has all of it's images and assets available in order to function properly.
